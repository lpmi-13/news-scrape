Trump supporter charged with assaulting protesters settles case with NAACP donation

Raymond Deskins has agreed to a payout of $3,000 to his local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) after he was charged with assaulting protesters outside Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia.

According to the Loudoun Times, Deskins was charged with assault for blowing on two activists in November. A viral video showed the 61-year-old not wearing a mask and purposefully taking a deep breath and blowing on two people at the area protesting former President Donald Trump. Deskins wore a pool toy fashioned in the likeness of Trump and a Trump t-shirt during the incident. 

“That’s assault,” one of the victims exclaimed as he shouted “I breathed on you.”

The Times reported law enforcement conducted an official investigation as the short clip did not show the full scope of the interaction.  Both parties were advised to seek a citizen-obtained warrant from a Loudoun County magistrate. A warrant was later served to Deskins and he then faced a misdemeanor assault charge. 
Kathy Beynette, who filed the complaint along with Patricia Razeghi, expressed disdain against the process. 

“We had to do all the work ourselves. We had to be the victims of the crime. We had to be the law enforcers for the crime. It was it was pretty unpleasant,” she remarked.

With the misdemeanor charge, Deskins could have spent up to a year in jail and paid a $2,500 fine months later. Instead, Beynette and Razeghi offered a different solution. The Loudoun Times reported the two women recommended he make a donation to the NAACP Loudoun Branch for its scholarship fund. Deskins issued a $3,000 check to the organization through his attorney Michelle Thomas. 
“I’m grateful for them,” Thomas said according to the news outlet. “Helping kids achieve their college dreams is a great way to respond to bad with good.”
The women are satisfied although they did not get justice for the attack against them. According to the Times, both have protective orders against Deskins.

“We were really up against it, and it took a lot to get this thing to go to court,” Razeghi said. “It took a lot of pushing, but we did it. So, we figured we got to make something good out of it.”

According to its website, NAACP Loudoun was as chartered on March 24, 1940, around the issue of equal education opportunities and made landmark strides for Black residents in the community.
On a national scale, the NAACP has called for an investigation against Trump for targeting Black voters in Georgia. theGrio reported the former president allegedly committed voter and election crimes with an unprecedented and illegal request for Georgia election officials to change the state’s certified vote count.  
This matter has drawn the attention of many, including organizations like the NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights group, which is now calling for an investigation.
“There is an overall picture that has developed. Obviously, [President Trump] has targeted Black electorates. Places that are majority Black populations,” NAACP Board Chairman Leon Russell exclusively told theGrio.
“We believe the U.S. attorneys in Washington D.C. and Fulton County, Georgia should be looking at this case. We believe there have been state laws that have been violated. District attorneys ought to look at this case as well, as the president tried to unlawfully influence the outcome of an election,” said Russell.

But 1989 was a long-ass time ago, and my, oh my, have things changed. Although the show’s cartoon characters aren’t subject to aging, the world around the Simpsons clan has kept up its societal reference points, leading some to ponder the question: Can a prototypical nuclear family à la Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie survive American’s modern economic horrors?Advertisement...C’mon. We all know the answer to that one.And so does NPR’s Planet Money, which last month aired a story examining whether or not we could consider the Simpsons a “middle-class” family by 2021's standards. To do this, they spoke with Dani Alexis Ryskamp, author of the Atlantic essay “The Life in The Simpsons Is No Longer Attainable.” Ryskamp went to super-fan lengths to determine the exact dollars and cents, such as pinpointing an exact shot of Homer’s paycheck in a 1996 episode and extrapolating that he would have made about $25,000 that year.“Back in 1996, the median household income was about $35,000. So if Homer’s salary stayed in the same place relative to the median household income, Homer would be earning around $50,000 today, which is definitely a solid salary,” explains Planet Money’s co-host, Stacey Vanek Smith, before Ryskamp morbidly reminds us, “Tuition has more than doubled. Health care costs have more than doubled. I believe housing costs have more than doubled.”“The idea that you could have one breadwinner in a family of five who had a high-school education, working a union job at a power plant and buying a nice house in the suburbs and supporting a spouse and these three other kids...at this point, [it’s] not normal but aspirational,” they continue.So, yeah. Basically, most people would kill for Homer’s originally mediocre, middle-of-the-road lifestyle these days. Is The Simpsons an accurate depiction of middle-class life? Definitely no. Is it still funny?

Hard pass. By Eric Zorn Chicago Tribune | Mar 11, 2021 at 3:47 PM (Hill Street Studios / Getty Images) The campaign literature in voters’ mailboxes was vicious, dishonest, over the top and vaguely nauseating, rife with accusations of racism, incompetence and greed. One digitally altered image in particular showed a Jewish candidate clutching a fistful of cash and wearing a garish dollar-symbol pendant around his neck. Another insinuated that a candidate was responsible for a sexual molestation scandal. Politics as usual, in other words. Nothing that would truly shock anyone who’s lived through a few election seasons in the Chicago area. These attack mailers, however, were from the 2020 school board elections in the Los Angeles Unified School District, where voters and not the mayor are responsible for selecting the seven members who shape education policy in the second-largest public school system in the country. It’s also where a national record $17.7 million was spent last year as various factions tried to gain the upper hand in the long-running battle between teachers unions and charter school advocates. I mention this since the perennial idea of electing members of the school board in Chicago — the nation’s third-largest district — is again in the news. Democratic state Sen. Robert Martwick introduced Senate Bill 2497 last month calling for a change that activists have long championed, that Mayor Lori Lightfoot has said she is behind, that has passed both chambers in the General Assembly in various forms in recent years, that the Chicago Teachers Union backs and that voters in 2015 nonbinding referendums supported by a nearly 9 to 1 margin. It certainly sounds great. Democracy! Make those who oversee the operation of this vital government service directly accountable to voters, as they are in every other school district in Illinois and most school districts in the nation. Give parents “a seat at the table,” as Lightfoot has put it. Don’t leave it to the mayor to hand-pick the members of the board to do her bidding. Not only is the idea philosophically appealing, it seems to work pretty well in smaller districts where particularly engaged community residents provide oversight, often in obscurity and for little or no money. “Quick, if you live outside Chicago — who’s your school board president?” asked a Tribune editorial in 2011. “No clue, right?” ________ Columns are opinion content that reflect the views of the writers. ________ The campaigns in smaller districts are usually fairly quiet because the stakes are usually fairly low. But in Chicago, the stakes are always very high, the battles intense, the feelings raw. And the city’s mayor, who has appointed nearly every member of the Chicago Board of Education since its founding in 1872, is ultimately responsible for the results in the classroom. Would it be better to cede that responsibility to a panel of informed, involved, objective, serious citizens, a sort of super-PTA? Maybe! But that’s not what’s happened in Los Angeles, where school board races have turned into ideological proxy fights, with each amounting to “another descent into the gutter” as LA Times columnist Steve Lopez put it last year. “It would be nice to get through one school board election without vile, smarmy personal attacks, distortions and outright lies,” he wrote. “I find this kind of manure particularly odious in school board elections, when adults should be setting a better example for the kids.” In the 2020 primary and general election cycle for just four seats in Los Angeles, the campaigns spent about $1.2 million to promote their candidates. But outside groups — largely dueling supporters of the charter school movement and of supporters of unionized teachers who tend to oppose charter schools — spent roughly $16.5 million, nearly 14 times that amount, to bombard the voters with propaganda. The resulting board in LA now has a narrow advantage for charter proponents. But such a result would be far from guaranteed in Chicago, where the Chicago Teachers Union has in recent years demonstrated that it has considerable muscle to flex. All that we could be sure of would be periodic epic mud fights between people from all over the country with competing philosophical interests in education policy and hopes of influencing how we run our schools. In the naive hope of giving interested local parents a “seat at the table” we would, like Los Angeles, give special interests from coast to coast a lever to yank on without definitive proof that students are better off when school boards are elected. If such elections are held in off years, turnout will likely be low — fewer than 9% of eligible voters participated in a 2019 special school board election in Los Angeles. And if they’re held at the same time as other major elections — to counter the low turnout problem, Los Angeles held school board elections to coincide with the presidential election last November — average voters are less likely to have focused enough on the down-ballot school races to cast truly informed votes. No thanks. The appeal of direct democracy reaches its limit here for me. I’d rather delegate the responsibility for schools to the mayor — as we do responsibility for law enforcement, fire protection and other vital matters — and vote accordingly every four years. ericzorn@gmail.com Twitter @EricZorn Get the week’s best columns, reports, tips, referrals and tirades from columnist Eric Zorn in the Change of Subject newsletter.

View CommentsMississippi Governor Tate Reeves signs the first state bill in the US this year to ban transgender athletes from competing on female sports teams, as supporting lawmakers gather behind him on Thursday at the Capitol in Jackson, Miss.Rogelio V. SolisJACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Republican Governor Tate Reeves signed a bill Thursday to ban transgender athletes from competing on girls or women’s sports teams.Mississippi is the first state this year to enact such a ban, after a federal court blocked an Idaho law last year. Mississippi’s Senate Bill 2536 is set to become law July 1, although a legal challenge is possible.More than 20 states are proposing restrictions on athletics or gender-confirming health care for transgender minors this year. Conservative lawmakers are responding to an executive order by President Biden that bans discrimination based on gender identity in school sports and elsewhere. Biden signed it Jan. 20, the day he took office.Advertisement“But for the fact that President Biden as one of his first initiatives sat down and signed an executive order — which, in my opinion, encourages transgenderism amongst our young people — but for that fact, we wouldn’t be here today,” Reeves said during a ceremony in the Mississippi Capitol, where he was joined by legislators who supported the bill.Alphonso David, president of the LGBTQ civil rights organization Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement Thursday that the Mississippi law could lead to more bullying of transgender people.“This law is a solution in search of a problem, and legislators in Mississippi have not provided any examples of Mississippi transgender athletes gaming the system for a competitive advantage because none exist,” David said.Reeves has three daughters who play sports and he said March 4 on Twitter that Mississippi’s bill would “protect young girls from being forced to compete with biological males for athletic opportunities.”Chase Strangio, a transgender-rights attorney with the national ACLU, said the Mississippi bill “is very vague and seemingly unenforceable.”“Unfortunately, there is already rampant discrimination against trans youth in Mississippi, which means people are already driven out of sport,” Strangio said.AdvertisementThe Mississippi Senate passed the bill Feb. 11, and the House passed it March 3. The votes were largely along party lines, with most Republicans supporting the bill and most Democrats either opposing it or refraining from voting.Republican legislators who pushed the bill gave no evidence of any transgender athletes competing in Mississippi schools or universities.“The coaches have told me that this is an imminent problem in Mississippi, and that’s basically all the details that they were willing to give me,” Republican Senator Angela Hill of Picayune said in response to questions Thursday. “I can’t tell you that they don’t know any examples. I believe they do know examples. I think that they wanted to leave it in general terms. But they told me that this is an urgent matter.”Supporters of bills such as the one in Mississippi argue that transgender girls, because they were born male, are naturally stronger, faster, and bigger than those born female. Opponents say such proposals violate not only Title IX of federal education law prohibiting sex discrimination, but also rulings by the US Supreme Court and US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.Boston Globe videoFollow Us Share on TwitterShare on Facebook Share on InstagramShare on TwitterShare on Facebook Share on InstagramSubscribe NowDigital AccessHome DeliveryGift SubscriptionsMy AccountLog InManage My AccountCustomer ServiceContactHelp & FAQsGlobe NewsroomAdvertiseMoreNewslettersView the ePaperOrder Back IssuesNews in EducationSearch the ArchivesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of PurchaseWork at Boston Globe Media©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC

With kidney disease a worldwide problem, including 37 million sufferers in the U.S. alone and an increasing issue in Israel, World Kidney Day seeks to highlight the importance of kidney health across the world.
By promoting a global awareness campaign centered on the importance of kidneys and how to keep your kidneys healthy, the special day emphasizes how everyone can live a lifestyle that is best for kidney health, even if living with the impact of kidney disease. The theme for 2021 is "Kidney Health for Everyone Everywhere – Living Well with Kidney Disease."
World Kidney Day "aims to increase education and awareness about effective symptom management and patient empowerment, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the meaningful participation in every-day life of people living with kidney disease" and to empower patients and their family members in their care and in all aspects of the disease.
The International Federation of Kidney Foundations – World Kidney Alliance, which founded the day, stresses that a disease-centric approach is not the best way to help patients dealing with chronic kidney disease to live a full life. Rather, there are strategies and approaches to handle and minimize symptoms and outcomes in order to improve quality of life and increase participation in everyday activities.
“Diet and salt intake, access to health care, and access to exercise make a huge difference in kidney health,” Dr. Anupam Agarwal told University of Alabama News.
Ten percent of the world's population has chronic kidney disease (CKD), and over 2 million people are on dialysis treatment or awaiting a transplant.

Microsoft Begins the Process to Shutdown Window Store for Business and Education


Microsoft 365 

Brad Sams | Mar 11, 2021 



If there is one thing that has not materialized in a way that Microsoft had hoped, it would be app stores. The store on Windows 10, while it is filled with apps, has not lived up to the business objectives that were initially outlined and the same can be said for other stores like business and education.
And now it looks like Microsoft is taking more decisive action, at least for the business and education storefronts. The company has announced, via MC244068, that the company is starting to close down the business and education stores.
Specifically, the company says in the message that all apps that are sold, meaning every app that is not free, will no longer be available for purchase in the business or education stores. Further, anonymous browsing of the stores has been disabled and only those with active Azure AD accounts will be able to view the content.
It’s important to note that Minecraft of Education is not impacted by these changes.
If you have purchased apps from these marketplaces, you will still be able to receive updates and access your applications but you can no longer purchase new apps or licenses going forward. After these changes take place, which will occur on April 14th, you will still be able to assign and re-assign the licenses that you have already purchased.



This is a big change for Microsoft and acknowledgment that its store tactics have not materialized in a way that has provided enough value to keep these tools around. If you are a user of this tool or are selling products via this method, this is going to be a big change to your operation.
While this is not the complete shutdown of these storefronts, this is the first big step to sunsetting the services.

Polish-born researcher and professor Marie Curie is arguably the most well-known female scientist of all time. With an intellect that would have been exceptional in any age, Curie was also remarkable for her achievements in fields dominated almost exclusively by men during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. A woman participating in physics, chemistry, or academia was by its very occurence a pioneering feat. Thankfully, Curie's accomplishments have largely escaped the frequent pitfall for barrier-breaking women—that they are remembered more for their gender than their contributions to their field.
Curie's name has largely become synonymous with the study of radiation. This research likely contributed to the aplastic anaemia which caused her premature death at age 66. Madame Curie handled radioactive isotopes without modern safety procedures, which themselves grew out of her discoveries. Her work, however, has saved countless lives. Radiation therapy is used today as a treatment for certain cancers; Curie was the first to attempt this medical use based on her study of radioactive isotopes in her lab. As the first woman to win a Nobel Prize—and the only person to ever win two in separate scientific fields—Curie is one of the most decorated and respected scientists of any gender. Read on to learn more about the life of an extraordinary mind.
 

Academic from an Early Age

Curie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland as Maria Salomea Skłodowska. The young woman’s father was a mathematics and physics teacher, while her mother ran a school for girls. Despite being well-placed for an excellent education Curie faced several major obstacles. The first, of course, was her gender. She received a high school education at a girl's gymnasium—women were not allowed to attend the local universities. Her Polish nationality (of which she was always proud) posed another issue. Poland was under the control of Russia, and her family had a history of involvement in the Polish resistance to imperial rule. In pursuit of higher education, Curie attended an underground learning institution known as Uniwersytet Latający, or the Flying University.
The Flying University was affordable but clandestine. Originally designed for women to attend, the classes also served as a way to keep Polish culture and academia alive under Russian rule. Despite the ingenuity of the Flying University's model, Curie and her sister Bronisława both wished to study in Paris. She worked several years as a governor and tutor in Poland to support her sister’s medical training in Paris. After her sister's marriage, Curie continued working, studying, and reading. Her first laboratory work was conducted in her cousin's chemistry lab in Warsaw the year before she left Poland. In 1891, she departed her homeland to join her sister in Paris to take her next step in academia.
 
Paris and Pierre

In Paris, Curie became known as Marie (Maria in French) and enrolled at the University of Paris where she focused on physics, chemistry, and math. By 1894, she had achieved two degrees. She was studying magnetism when she met another scientist named Pierre Curie who taught at The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution. Marie joined Pierre’s lab, and he soon fell head over heels for the brilliant young woman. Far from prioritizing his own career, he offered to return to Poland with her if that was what it took to convince her to marry him. However, Marie's career opportunities were limited in Poland, so the couple remained in France. They wed in 1895.
 
A Woman in a Man's World

Working with her husband, Curie began the work required to obtain her PhD. The French physicist Henri Becquerel had recently discovered puzzling rays emanating from uranium. The German scientist Wilhelm Roentgen had also first documented the existence of x-rays. Both phenomenons would become the central questions of Curie’s studies. However, being a married woman in a man's world was difficult in an age when middle and upper-class mothers typically remained at home. In 1897, Curie gave birth to a daughter, Irène. Despite being a new parent, Curie was actively researching other elements that emitted mysterious rays. Her husband joined her, and together in 1898 they published their discovery of the elements polonium (named for Poland) and radium.
The Curies described the elements' mysterious waves as radioactivity, a new term in science. They began to attempt to isolate the elements from the compounds they had previously studied. This was difficult given radioactive elements decay. In 1903, Curie submitted her doctoral thesis addressing radioactivity, entitled Research on Radioactive Substances. She presented the basis of radioactivity and its connection to the structure of atoms. Despite her expertise in the subject, conferences requested her husband as a speaker while she was not invited to address the almost entirely male audience.
 
International Acclaim

In 1903, the same year Marie defended her thesis, the Curies’ work caught the attention of the Nobel Prize Committee. Together with Becquerel, the three scientists were awarded the Physics prize for “their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel.” Marie almost did not receive the award despite her work being arguably the most critical discoveries. Upon hearing that his wife and research partner was not listed for the award, Pierre complained to the committee. Her inclusion was not only right, but a monumental step for female scientists.
In 1906, after the birth of their second child, Pierre was killed in a freak traffic accident in Paris. The University of Paris offered a teaching post promised him to his widow. Devastated at the end of what (by all accounts) seems to have been a true love match with her intellectual soulmate, Curie nonetheless became the first female professor in the almost-800-year history of the university. She became quite distinguished within a decade, with a lab dedicated to the study of radium as a joint endeavor in 1914 between the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.

In 1911, Curie was awarded her second Nobel Prize—this time solo and in Chemistry. The award cited her isolation of the element radium, which she and Pierre had previously discovered. That same year, she attended the first Solvay Conference. This elite gathering of the best minds in the world included Albert Einstein, Max Planck, and Henri Poincaré. Curie was the only woman in attendance, but the entire theme of the conference built upon her work. The attendees discussed “Radiation and the Quanta” from a physics angle. Despite this recognition, Curie returned to a scandal in France. A short affair with a married, but separated, peer scientist proved the vulnerability of her position as a leading female academic. The press coverage was xenophobic as well as sexist.

At her Radium Institute, Curie had been researching the medical applications of her work. Before even receiving her PhD, Curie and her husband had published the effects of radium on cancer cells. With the commencement of the Great War, Curie poured her prize money into war bonds and developed field radiology equipment. Working with her daughter, she trained and directed Red Cross nurses. Her radiology operations treated (and likely saved) untold numbers of soldiers. Her post-war profile—and prolific uses of radium—even earned her a visit to the White House to meet President Warren G. harding. He presented her with a gram of radium (a large amount) to continue her work.
 
The Curie Legacy

In large part, Curie built her own legacy during her lifetime. The Radium Institute is now the Curie Institute, a leader in oncology research. During her lifetime, a Parisian street was given her husband's name, and a radioactivity unit of measure was named the curie. In 1935, her son-in-law and her daughter Irène received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their continuation of her research. Curie passed away the year before, having taken a huge health toll from years of unwitting exposure to extremely radioactive material.
Since her death, Marie Curie has been the namesake of hospitals, museums, and universities dedicated to continuing her brilliant discoveries. An element on the Periodic Table is known as Curium in her and Pierre's honor. The two Curies are buried in the 18th-century Panthéon in Paris—in lead-lined coffins. Even their papers are housed in lead due to the lingering effects of radiation. Curie dedicated her life to science, and in a relatively short career managed to discover the basis of a cancer treatment that today is still the best medicine available. A source of pride to both Poland and France, Curie laid the foundations for generations of women and young scientists.

SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sports For Learning (SFL), an innovative provider of educational support programs with a curriculum that blends social emotional learning (SEL) and physical activity, is aiding nearly 60 school districts across California in getting children back to school safely. Its blended curriculum is aligned with the five core competencies of CASEL (self-awareness, self-management, responsible decision-making, relationship skills and social awareness) as well as California’s physical education standards. It is currently providing relief staff and SEL support for the return to school as well as synchronous and asynchronous distance learning with programs that use fun, physically active games and sports as a vehicle to engage students in social and emotional learning.



“Getting kids safely back to school has presented a host of challenges. District administrators are struggling with stretched resources, teachers are often working double-shifts with morning and afternoon cohorts to keep class sizes small, and students that have been struggling with depression linked to isolation need social-emotional support as they re-engage in school,” said Chris Murphy co-founder and president at Sports For Learning. “We are glad to be working with schools and superintendents to create customizable solutions to address this immediate demand and are proud to be part of the solution for getting kids back to school safely.”

As a first-of-its-kind program uniquely positioned to help school districts confront the challenges of returning to classrooms in a post-pandemic world, SFL has developed more than 36 games and activities customized to ensure children remain both physically distanced and highly engaged. The curriculum supports overall whole-person wellness – academically, socially, emotionally and physically – for students of all ages through a variety of innovative safe-play activities. SFL’s experienced coaches supervise activities on-campus to provide teachers the time they need to take breaks and engage in professional development time, meaning districts can stretch their existing resources further, while parents and students enjoy the proven benefits of access to enriching SEL curriculum.

“Sports For Learning uses physical activity as a vehicle to increase children’s engagement and development, which boosts pro-social behaviors and mitigates disciplinary issues,” added Nick Telford, Sports f=For Learning’s co-founder and CEO. “Of the school districts we have already worked with, 98 percent of district administrators agree that the program has had a positive impact on students’ social emotional wellness resulting in fewer disciplinary issues, better attendance and higher engagement. These outcomes underscore how truly valuable social-emotional learning is in general, but especially in today’s uncertain climate.”

SFL partners with 30 of the 58 counties in California including schools throughout Orange County, Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and Riverside counties and continues to expand access to its online and in-person programs through rollouts at new schools and within new districts.

Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father – Picture: Netflix
One of the best travel-comedy shows on Netflix, Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father, is set to be coming back for a fifth season later in 2021 according to new report from Comedy.co.uk. 
The report states that Jack Whitehall and his father will be back for their fifth global outing but stresses that it’ll be slightly different to seasons beforehand whereby they’ll be sticking locally likely due to the travel restrictions of the global pandemic.
Scotland, Wales and England will be the focus of this round of travels with the pair visiting picturesque British locations including Devon, London, and the Lake District. Filming is due to begin in April 2021.
For those not familiar with the show, it follows a British comedian and his stuck-in-the-mud father traveling the globe with learning and laughs to be had along the way. The first season debuted in 2017 with new seasons releasing every year since.
So far, the pair have visited South East Asia, Europe, the United States and Australia.
Netflix confirmed the report and stated that season 5 of Jack Whitehall’s Travels with My Father will release on Netflix globally later in 2021.

While you’re waiting you can find plenty more Jack Whitehall on Netflix. His most prolific show Bad Education and its subsequent movie are sadly no longer available on Netflix (departing in December 2020 in the US and May 2020 in the UK) but you can find him in his various stand-ups. That includes the 2017 special Jack Whitehall: At Large, Jack Whitehall: Christmas with My Father from December 2019 and the most recent I’m Only Joking special from July 2020.
Are you looking forward to more Jack Whitehall with his father galavanting around the United Kingdom? Let us know in the comments down below.

Microsoft to block users from getting paid apps from the Microsoft Stores for Business, Education as of April
Is Microsoft finally taking the first official step toward the planned closing of the Microsoft Stores for Business and Education? It looks like it.

 More than a year after plans for closing the Microsoft Stores for Business and Education were discussed internally, Microsoft is notifying customers of the first steps toward their seeming dismantling. Microsoft Store for Business customers reported receiving an update today, March 11, telling them that all paid apps will no longer "be available for acquisition" from the Stores for Business and Education as of April 14, 2021. (Thanks @hoyty for the heads up on Twitter.)Users who already have apps they got through these stores will be able to use and receive updates to them, according to Microsoft's note to users. But no new paid apps will be possible through these stores as of that April date. After that date, users who want additional applications or licenses will need to work with app publishers, Microsoft says. The note to customers also says that access to the Store for Business and Store for Education, going forward, will require users to have an existing Azure Active Directory account. No anonymous browsing of these Stores will be permitted.I asked Microsoft if today's announcement is the first step toward toward the dismantling and closing of the Stores for Business and Education. No word back so far.The Microsoft Store, originally known as the Windows Store, is Microsoft's online app store that is built into Windows 10. In 2015, Microsoft started testing a couple of companion digital stores: The Microsoft Store for Business and the Microsoft Store for Education were designed for admins who wanted to make applications available to their users outside of the normal Windows Store channel in Windows 10. They allow admins to make Store apps available to their users for volume acquisition and distribution, as well as provide a way for custom line-of-business distribution only inside a particular organizationAs Microsoft officials acknowledged for the past couple of years, Microsoft's original plan to try to convince developers to create Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that would be updatable and distributable solely via the Microsoft Store failed to materialize. The need for dedicated app stores on Windows became less pressing as a result. To date, Microsoft hasn't said anything publicly about what's going to happen to any of its digital app stores. But privately, officials across various teams at the company had been trying to come up with a concerted strategy, I've heard. As of a year ago, That strategy did not call for Microsoft to drop the Web version of the Microsoft Store. It does sound as though the team that owns the digital stores decided that the Store for Business and Store for Education definitely would be deprecated. There was talk that June 2020 was the target, but that was pre-pandemic.

Facebook Pulls “Culture Fit” Card on Black Applicant With Ph.D.

Photo: Elise Amendola/APMedia and guests mingle before a tour of Facebook’s new offices in Cambridge, Mass., on Jan. 9, 2019. Photo: Elise Amendola/APA Black woman passed over for a job at Facebook told federal regulators that even though she was exceptionally qualified for the position, she was rushed through interviews with entirely white staffers, told she wouldn’t like the job, and advised that the company wanted a strong “culture fit,” according to a complaint to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission provided to The Intercept.
The woman joins three others who have recently complained to the EEOC about anti-Black racism at Facebook. The agency has begun conducting a “systemic” probe of Facebook, looking into whether the company’s own policies further discrimination, Reuters reported earlier this month.Join Our NewsletterOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.I’m inThe complaint comes as evidence piles up that large Silicon Valley companies are not diversifying their predominately white and Asian work forces quickly enough, particularly within high-paying technical and managerial roles. Facebook’s latest diversity report, from July, stated that only 3.9 percent of its U.S. employees were Black and 6.3 percent Hispanic. Google said that in 2020 its U.S. staff was 5.5 percent Black and 6.6 percent Latinx, and, like Facebook, has faced repeated accusations of racist practices, including, just in the last week, that it de-prioritizes applicants from historically Black colleges and universities and that it pushes people who complain about racism to seek mental health care.
The woman, whose attorneys shared her complaint with The Intercept on the condition that she not be named, alleges she was “subjected to Facebook’s pattern or practice of discrimination against Black applicants” during a series of interviews for a managerial position at the company in 2020. In the complaint, filed in December, the applicant says her prior work experience and directly related doctoral degree made her particularly well-suited for the job: partnerships and program manager at Facebook’s Global Impact Partnerships. She adds that her experience and education were brought up only in an early interview with the position’s hiring manager, who she alleges told her, “You have a big brain, you wouldn’t like this job.”
Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.
In the complaint, the applicant says she made it past the initial screening process and was granted further interviews, culminating in a round of in-person meetings with a group of all-white Facebook employees in San Francisco, during which she “sensed that the interviewers were not prioritizing her interviews because all of the interviews seemed rushed after making her wait for several hours.” The complaint notes that the applicant wasn’t interviewed by a single person of color and that the “only Black Facebook employee [she] encountered during the entire hiring process was a receptionist.”
She further alleges that during one of the in-person interviews in California, she was told, “There’s no doubt you can do the job, but we’re really looking for a culture fit.” The term “culture fit” is common in corporate tech culture, typically defined as the quality of hiring someone you’d want to hang out with socially or grab a beer with, but often criticized as little more than a euphemistic stand-in for racial or gender-based discrimination and a way for companies to deflect accusations of hiring bias. Given the overwhelming racial homogeneity of American tech companies and the pervasive belief that they require some sort of common vision of the future as much as any technical skill, determining what the “culture” in question even is or how one might “fit” into it can be impossible if an applicant doesn’t closely resemble a company’s founders or current staff.
Indeed, the applicant’s complaint states that Facebook’s “general policy of discrimination against Black applicants” is built partly on “Facebook’s strong consideration of ‘culture fit’ in hiring, without providing sufficient objective guidance to managers and other employees on how to determine which applicants and employees will be a good ‘culture fit’ at Facebook.”
The three other recent EEOC complaints about Facebook made similar allegations that Facebook relied on “culture fit” and evaluation by white and Asian employees to determine who made the cut. They were filed by Facebook employee Oscar Veneszee Jr. and by two applicants turned down for jobs. All four individuals are represented by attorneys from Gupta Wessler PLLC, Katz Marshall & Banks, and Mehri & Skalet.Wait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn’t done it?

Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren’t on the beat?

The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don’t have ads, so we depend on our members — 35,000 and counting — to help us hold the powerful to account.

WASHINGTON, March 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- On Friday, March 19, the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) celebrates Match Day for the 2021 NRMP Main Residency Match. Medical school students and graduates from the United States and around the world will learn in which U.S. residency program they will train for the next three to seven years. Match Day marks the finale of Match Week (March 15-19) and is a momentous occasion for the next generation of physicians. 
"The NRMP is honored to provide a fair, efficient, and reliable Match for thousands of medical students and graduates as they look forward to entering their specialty training," says NRMP President and CEO Donna L. Lamb, DHSc, MBA, BSN. "COVID-19 presented many challenges to the medical education community including remote learning, disrupted clinical rotations, and virtual interviews and we are in awe of the grit and determination medical students and graduates have shown over this past year. Congratulations to all of this year's Match participants."
Match Week ScheduleMatch Week begins on Monday, March 15, at 11:00 a.m. ET when applicants learn if they have matched to a training program. Monday through Thursday, unmatched applicants participate in the Match Week Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program® (SOAP®) to apply for positions that did not fill when the matching algorithm was processed. On Match Day, Friday, March 19, at 12:00 p.m. ET, NRMP releases the results of the Match, including the Advance Data Tables which include key data about Match results.  Additional data will be published in early May in the 2021 Main Residency Match Results and Data Book.

Follow the Joint Match Week Celebration!The NRMP, American Medical Association (AMA), Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)  American Osteopathic Association (AOA), and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) will join together to celebrate the 2021 Main Residency Match on Twitter, Tagboard, and YouTube, Match participants and the medical education community are encouraged to post pictures, videos, and congratulatory messages commemorating the event, and those interested in the transition from undergraduate to graduate medical education are encouraged to follow #Match2021 on social media. 
The Match ProcessFor applicants, the Main Residency Match process begins in the fall during the final year of medical school, when they apply to the residency programs of their choice. Throughout the fall and early winter, applicants interview with programs. From February to early March, applicants and program directors rank each other in order of preference and submit the preference lists to NRMP, which processes them using a computerized mathematical algorithm to match applicants with programs. Research using the NRMP algorithm was a basis for awarding The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2012.
About NRMPThe National Resident Matching Program® (NRMP®) is a private, non-profit organization established in 1952 at the request of medical students to provide an orderly and fair mechanism for matching the preferences of applicants for U.S. residency positions with the preferences of residency program directors. In addition to the annual Main Residency Match® for more than 48,000 registrants, the NRMP conducts Fellowship Matches for more than 60 subspecialties through its Specialties Matching Service® (SMS®).
To schedule an interview with NRMP President and CEO Donna L. Lamb, DHSc, MBA, BSN contact [email protected]. Reporters should contact local medical schools and hospitals directly for details on their Match Day activities and residency program activities.

NT Electoral Commission audit finds $88,000 discrepancy in CLP financial disclosures - ABC News

The audit, conducted by an accounting firm, found a discrepancy of $88,346 between the CLP's electoral disclosure returns published on the NTEC website and receipts in the party's accounting systems.The review said the CLP's accountant excluded receipts with values under $1,500 dollars, when the law required the total of all receipts to be reported.CLP president Jamie DeBrenni told the ABC the party responded to the NTEC soon after the report's publication on Thursday afternoon, to give it the information it required. "As of this afternoon, the CLP has fulfilled all the requirements asked for by the NTEC to their satisfaction and we thank them for working with the party in a courteous way," he said."These are new processes that everyone is working with and all organisations seem to be doing the best they can to comply."How do political donations work in the NT?The way politicians and parties raise money is undergoing change across Australia, and the ABC has looked into whether the Northern Territory's system is becoming more fair and transparent.Read moreA spokesman for the NTEC said it had received the CLP's revised figures and the website would be updated to reflect this.The changes to the NT's electoral donation and expenditure laws include an expenditure cap of $1 million dollars for political parties with 25 candidates and a $40,000 cap for individual candidates.There is also a requirement to set up and operate a campaign-specific bank account to ensure transparency around donations and expenditure.Overall, the NTEC audit found there had been a "satisfactory" level of compliance from political parties and candidates with the new rules.Third-party spending a threat to transparencyBut the auditors recommended the NTEC push the NT Government for a third-party campaigner spending cap to ensure transparency. The NTEC's auditors have urged it to push for a cap on third-party campaigner spending at elections.(Thinkstock: iStockphoto)Third-party campaigners in the NT have included organisations like unions, environmental groups, GetUp and the Friends of Fannie Bay group. "There is no limit on what the third-party campaigners can spend in respect of electoral activities during the election period while there is a spending cap of $40,000 on candidates," the audit report said."This situation may end up undermining the relevance of the spending cap imposed on candidates as electoral activity spending may be redirected through the third-party campaigners."There is currently no requirement for third-party campaigners to keep separate bank accounts so the NTEC's auditors had trouble identifying their expenses.The auditors noted that despite requests they could not get any information from the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union for the purposes of the review."As a result, we are unable to determine the accuracy and completeness of the figures disclosed in the disclosure return lodged with the NTEC and whether the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union has complied with all its obligations under the Electoral Act," the report states.Confusion about electorate office resourcesThe review also found confusion among different party candidates about rules that prohibit the use of electorate office resources during an election campaign period."An instance was encountered in which the sitting member mentioned that there were insufficient guidelines to follow in relation to the utilisation of electorate office resources during the deemed election period," the report said.More education for sitting members about these rules was needed, the auditors said.Labor needed a better process for refunding self-funded candidates promptly, according to the review, but was the only party that kept track of volunteer activity with a register."The register is essential where consideration has to be made if the volunteer activity is considered as deemed donations to the party and would require reporting," the report said.The review noted the NT Greens set up a campaign bank account only in July 2020, about a month before the election, and that the account had also been used for non-election transactions.Posted 31mminutes agoThuThursday 11 MarMarch 2021 at 9:29pmShareCopy linkTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppRelated StoriesHow do political donations work in the Northern Territory?More on:NTDarwinAlice SpringsGovernment and PoliticsPolitical PartiesElectoral SystemNews in LanguageListen to the news in Warlpiri, Yolngu Matha and KriolTop Stories'Not a racist family': Prince William speaks after brother's comments in Oprah interviewAll Diana wanted was for her sons to be close.

Story Of America’s First Woman In Space Told In New Young Adult Book


 Thursday, March 11, 2021

The cover of "She Persisted: Sally Ride" is pictured.


Sally Ride, America’s first woman in space, left a legacy for young girls here in San Diego and around the world. 
Her history-making trips aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger and her work as a physicist at UC San Diego serve as an inspiration to women and girls interested in all-things science. 
Ride helped launch Sally Ride Science, which is now a nonprofit dedicated to inspiring kids, especially girls, to pursue studies and careers in science, technology, engineering, and math.
Now Ride’s story is being told along with 12 other inspiring women profiled in the "She Persisted" young adult book series. And Ride’s book is lucky enough to come out this month — Women's History Month.
The young adult series was inspired by Chelsea Clinton's picture book series that started off with, "She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World."
The author of "She Persisted: Sally Ride," Atia Abawi, joined Midday Edition to discuss Ride's life and legacy.

Second Democrat announces challenge against Cawthorn 


 By Sarah Polus - 03/11/21 04:27 PM EST

Josh Remillard, an Iraq war veteran, has become the second Democrat to announce a challenge to Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) in the next congressional election, according to the Citizen Times.The 38-year-old announced his candidacy for North Carolina's 11th District House seat on Wednesday in a statement obtained by the Citizen Times."I served in the Army for eight years, including two combat tours; I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and do the hard work of strengthening our economy, fixing a broken health-care system, and improving our kids’ education," Remillard wrote.ADVERTISEMENTRemillard is the second challenger to Cawthorn's seat. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, a local county commissioner, announced her plans to run against the first-term lawmaker last week.According to his website, Remillard plans to work to expand Medicaid, raise teacher pay and reduce the state's reliance on fossil fuels.Remillard also took aim at Cawthorn, 25, writing that "Western North Carolina deserves better."He added, "We deserve leaders that will uphold the Constitution and make our lives better, not someone who would incite insurrection and prey on women."Remillard's comment follows allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Cawthorn while he was attending college. The young congressman has also faced scrutiny over his role in inciting the Jan. 6 riot, after he spoke at a Trump rally in the nation's capital earlier that day.

‘Everybody Shouldn’t Be Voting,’ Republican Blurts Out


By Jonathan Chait









 


Photo: Ross D Franklin/AP/Shutterstock



Representative John Kavanagh, a Republican legislator who chairs Arizona’s Government and Elections Committee and is shepherding through a bill to make voting more cumbersome and therefore rare, described his party’s motives with blundering candor.
“There’s a fundamental difference between Democrats and Republicans,” he told CNN. “Democrats value as many people as possible voting, and they’re willing to risk fraud. Republicans are more concerned about fraud, so we don’t mind putting security measures in that won’t let everybody vote — but everybody shouldn’t be voting … Not everybody wants to vote, and if somebody is uninterested in voting, that probably means that they’re totally uninformed on the issues. Quantity is important, but we have to look at the quality of votes, as well.”
Kavanagh’s error was to articulate in public beliefs that conservatives prefer to leave to members of their movement who aren’t accountable to the electorate. If I had to guess, his argument is something he’s picked up from reading conservative media, and he never realized his role as elected official makes it unwise to repeat — especially on-camera.
Donald Trump’s presidency, with its continuous demands to silence his opposition and efforts to undermine the election, highlighted his party’s anti-democratic character. But hostility to democracy is a long tradition on the right, including (perhaps especially) in its loftiest highbrow quarters.
Respectable conservative organs like National Review not only supported segregation and opposed civil rights, but also opposed laws to safeguard voting rights. The NR formula on voting rights has always combined several classic elements. First, there are usually some arch, snobbish gibes at right-wing populist demagogues, who are crass and beneath the dignity of the deserving elites at National Review. Second, the dismissal of rank bigotry is set against a “frank” concession that most Black people do not actually deserve the franchise because they are, like the poor whites who support the demagogues, too ignorant to exercise their vote wisely. And third, it declares states’ rights to be the paramount consideration, so that ultimately no federal solution can be imposed, however troubling the abuses of the state-level authorities.
In 1965, James J. Kilpatrick’s National Review cover story dismissed the need for a Voting Rights Act. Yes, Kilpatrick conceded, white Southerns had mistreated Black people. (“No reasonable man would deny that in times past, the South has sinned against the Negro; here and there, in times present, the abuse continues.”) However, the fact remained, “Over most of this century, the great bulk of Southern Negroes have been genuinely unqualified for the franchise. They emerged illiterate from slavery; they remained for generations, metaphorically, under the age of twenty-one.” And the principle of federalism meant Congress could not dictate voting procedures to the states, so, sadly, the Voting Rights Act “undertakes to remedy a perversion of the Constitution by perverting the Constitution.”
A 1966 column by Buckley began with some mockery of Alabama governor George Wallace. But Buckley proceeded to his main point. “For some reason it has been hailed as a triumph of democratic justice that so many Negroes succeeding in voting last week,” he sneered, mocking the absurdity of illiterate Black Alabamans being permitted to vote. Weighing the competing absurdities of the two “evils” — Wallace’s buffoonery, or Black people voting despite having been denied an education by their state — he concluded “the latter” was worse. (The text of these columns are not online. Joshua Tait, a University of North Carolina historian specializing in conservative thought, shared the quotes with me.)
After the 1960s, most mainstream conservatives abandoned their defense of de jure segregation in the South, and two decades later had to abandon their defense of the same system in South Africa. But the idea that voting rights ought to be restricted remains a staple of conservative thought to this day. The chilly reception National Review and other right-wing elites afforded Trump was in keeping with their traditional contempt for demagoguery. But the danger they identified in him was not that he threatened democracy, but seemed in their mind to embody it. “We must weed out ignorant Americans from the electorate,” insisted David Harsanyi in 2016. National Review’s Kevin Williamson, in a column last year headlined “On the Dangers of Democracy,” warned, “The rising authoritarianism of our time is not an aberration but the ordinary natural fulfillment of mass democracy when it has overflowed its constitutional restraints.”
Conservatives are hysterical in opposition to proposals in Congress to guarantee voting access and limit gerrymandering. National Review calls H.R. 1, the main House bill to promote election reform, “a partisan assault on American democracy.” But NR should be more honest in its criticism: Democracy is not what it wants at all, and never has been.

Amazon doesn’t let public libraries purchase copies of the e-books and audiobooks it publishes
[Amazon] won’t sell downloadable versions of its more than 10,000 e-books or tens of thousands of audiobooks to libraries. That’s right, for a decade, the company that killed bookstores has been starving the reading institution that cares for kids, the needy and the curious. And that’s turned into a mission-critical problem during a pandemic that cut off physical access to libraries and left a lot of people unable to afford books on their own.… since 2009, Amazon has published books and audiobooks under its own brands including Lake Union, Thomas & Mercer and Audible. Amazon is a beast with many tentacles: It’s got the store, the reading devices and, increasingly, the words that go on them.Librarians have been no match for the beast. When authors sign up with a publisher, it decides how to distribute their work. With other big publishers, selling e-books and audiobooks to libraries is part of the mix — that’s why you’re able to digitally check out bestsellers like Barack Obama’s “A Promised Land.” Amazon is the only big publisher that flat-out blocks library digital collections. Search your local library’s website, and you won’t find recent e-books by Amazon authors Kaling, Dean Koontz or Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Nor will you find downloadable audiobooks for Trevor Noah’s “Born a Crime,” Andy Weir’s “The Martian” and Michael Pollan’s “Caffeine.”



Want to borrow that e-book from the library? Sorry, Amazon won’t let you.

Cincinnati State joining Miami, Xavier and UC in returning to campus in fall 2021Madeline Mitchell
 
| Cincinnati Enquirer
Cincinnati State Technical and Community College plans to return to fully in-person learning in fall 2021, officials announced Thursday afternoon.Cincinnati State is an open access college with locations in Clifton, Harrison, Evendale and Middletown. Miami University, University of Cincinnati and Xavier University made similar announcements regarding fall 2021 plans in March. Those universities and Cincinnati State cited the COVID-19 vaccine rollout as a source of optimism for reopening.Robbin Hoopes, provost of Cincinnati State, said the college's faculty, staff and students have done a "magnificent job" of dealing with the pandemic in a Thursday news release."As the risk from COVID comes down to an acceptable level, we need to be fully back on campus as part of our commitment to quality," Hoopes said. "Many of our degrees prepare students for careers in advanced technical, health care, culinary and other fields. In-person instruction is how we ensure students have the high level of training and hands-on skills they need to be successful in the workforce."There will still be some online classes available for students, just as there were prior to the pandemic, officials said. There will also be a "live web" platform available for many general education courses, where students can participate remotely with a live classroom on a regular schedule. Those general education courses are transferable to four-year universities throughout the state and nationwide.Cincinnati State will offer remote and on-campus student support services in the fall in the forms of tutoring, writing center support and academic advising."While this past year has been challenging for everyone, we learned a lot about how to better serve our busy students through a creative mix of in-person and remote education and services," Cincinnati State president Monica Posey said. "But we are very excited about being fully back on campus this fall, and continuing our mission of preparing students for advanced technical and health careers, and ongoing higher education."Cincinnati State students can register online beginning March 29, officials said. Fall semester course offerings will be posted March 22 on the university's website.

Raymond Deskins has agreed to a payout of $3,000 to his local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) after he was charged with assaulting protesters outside Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia.

According to the Loudoun Times, Deskins was charged with assault for blowing on two activists in November. A viral video showed the 61-year-old not wearing a mask and purposefully taking a deep breath and blowing on two people at the area protesting former President Donald Trump. Deskins wore a pool toy fashioned in the likeness of Trump and a Trump t-shirt during the incident. 

“That’s assault,” one of the victims exclaimed as he shouted “I breathed on you.”

The Times reported law enforcement conducted an official investigation as the short clip did not show the full scope of the interaction.  Both parties were advised to seek a citizen-obtained warrant from a Loudoun County magistrate. A warrant was later served to Deskins and he then faced a misdemeanor assault charge. 
Kathy Beynette, who filed the complaint along with Patricia Razeghi, expressed disdain against the process. 

“We had to do all the work ourselves. We had to be the victims of the crime. We had to be the law enforcers for the crime. It was it was pretty unpleasant,” she remarked.

With the misdemeanor charge, Deskins could have spent up to a year in jail and paid a $2,500 fine months later. Instead, Beynette and Razeghi offered a different solution. The Loudoun Times reported the two women recommended he make a donation to the NAACP Loudoun Branch for its scholarship fund. Deskins issued a $3,000 check to the organization through his attorney Michelle Thomas. 
“I’m grateful for them,” Thomas said according to the news outlet. “Helping kids achieve their college dreams is a great way to respond to bad with good.”
The women are satisfied although they did not get justice for the attack against them. According to the Times, both have protective orders against Deskins.

“We were really up against it, and it took a lot to get this thing to go to court,” Razeghi said. “It took a lot of pushing, but we did it. So, we figured we got to make something good out of it.”

According to its website, NAACP Loudoun was as chartered on March 24, 1940, around the issue of equal education opportunities and made landmark strides for Black residents in the community.
On a national scale, the NAACP has called for an investigation against Trump for targeting Black voters in Georgia. theGrio reported the former president allegedly committed voter and election crimes with an unprecedented and illegal request for Georgia election officials to change the state’s certified vote count.  
This matter has drawn the attention of many, including organizations like the NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights group, which is now calling for an investigation.
“There is an overall picture that has developed. Obviously, [President Trump] has targeted Black electorates. Places that are majority Black populations,” NAACP Board Chairman Leon Russell exclusively told theGrio.
“We believe the U.S. attorneys in Washington D.C. and Fulton County, Georgia should be looking at this case. We believe there have been state laws that have been violated. District attorneys ought to look at this case as well, as the president tried to unlawfully influence the outcome of an election,” said Russell.

But 1989 was a long-ass time ago, and my, oh my, have things changed. Although the show’s cartoon characters aren’t subject to aging, the world around the Simpsons clan has kept up its societal reference points, leading some to ponder the question: Can a prototypical nuclear family  à la Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie survive American’s modern economic horrors?Advertisement...C’mon. We all know the answer to that one.And so does NPR’s Planet Money, which last month aired a story examining whether or not we could consider the Simpsons a “middle-class” family by 2021's standards. To do this, they spoke with Dani Alexis Ryskamp, author of the Atlantic essay “The Life in The Simpsons Is No Longer Attainable.” Ryskamp went to super-fan lengths to determine the exact dollars and cents, such as pinpointing an exact shot of Homer’s paycheck in a 1996 episode and extrapolating that he would have made about $25,000 that year.“Back in 1996, the median household income was about $35,000. So if Homer’s salary stayed in the same place relative to the median household income, Homer would be earning around $50,000 today, which is definitely a solid salary,” explains Planet Money’s co-host, Stacey Vanek Smith, before Ryskamp morbidly reminds us, “Tuition has more than doubled. Health care costs have more than doubled. I believe housing costs have more than doubled.”“The idea that you could have one breadwinner in a family of five who had a high-school education, working a union job at a power plant and buying a nice house in the suburbs and supporting a spouse and these three other kids...at this point, [it’s] not normal but aspirational,” they continue.So, yeah. Basically, most people would kill for Homer’s originally mediocre, middle-of-the-road lifestyle these days. Is The Simpsons an accurate depiction of middle-class life? Definitely no. Is it still funny?

Hard pass.                  By Eric Zorn      Chicago Tribune |    Mar 11, 2021  at  3:47 PM                                          (Hill Street Studios / Getty Images)              The campaign literature in voters’ mailboxes was vicious, dishonest, over the top and vaguely nauseating, rife with accusations of racism, incompetence and greed. One digitally altered image in particular showed a Jewish candidate clutching a fistful of cash and wearing a garish dollar-symbol pendant around his neck. Another insinuated that a candidate was responsible for a sexual molestation scandal.     Politics as usual, in other words. Nothing that would truly shock anyone who’s lived through a few election seasons in the Chicago area.     These attack mailers, however, were from the 2020 school board elections in the Los Angeles Unified School District, where voters and not the mayor are responsible for selecting the seven members who shape education policy in the second-largest public school system in the country. It’s also where a national record $17.7 million was spent last year as various factions tried to gain the upper hand in the long-running battle between teachers unions and charter school advocates.     I mention this since the perennial idea of electing members of the school board in Chicago — the nation’s third-largest district — is again in the news. Democratic state Sen. Robert Martwick introduced Senate Bill 2497 last month calling for a change that activists have long championed, that Mayor Lori Lightfoot has said she is behind, that has passed both chambers in the General Assembly in various forms in recent years, that the Chicago Teachers Union backs and that voters in 2015 nonbinding referendums supported by a nearly 9 to 1 margin.     It certainly sounds great. Democracy! Make those who oversee the operation of this vital government service directly accountable to voters, as they are in every other school district in Illinois and most school districts in the nation. Give parents “a seat at the table,” as Lightfoot has put it. Don’t leave it to the mayor to hand-pick the members of the board to do her bidding.     Not only is the idea philosophically appealing, it seems to work pretty well in smaller districts where particularly engaged community residents provide oversight, often in obscurity and for little or no money.     “Quick, if you live outside Chicago — who’s your school board president?” asked a Tribune editorial in 2011. “No clue, right?”     ________     Columns are opinion content that reflect the views of the writers.     ________     The campaigns in smaller districts are usually fairly quiet because the stakes are usually fairly low. But in Chicago, the stakes are always very high, the battles intense, the feelings raw. And the city’s mayor, who has appointed nearly every member of the Chicago Board of Education since its founding in 1872, is ultimately responsible for the results in the classroom.     Would it be better to cede that responsibility to a panel of informed, involved, objective, serious citizens, a sort of super-PTA? Maybe! But that’s not what’s happened in Los Angeles, where school board races have turned into ideological proxy fights, with each amounting to “another descent into the gutter” as LA Times columnist Steve Lopez put it last year.     “It would be nice to get through one school board election without vile, smarmy personal attacks, distortions and outright lies,” he wrote. “I find this kind of manure particularly odious in school board elections, when adults should be setting a better example for the kids.”     In the 2020 primary and general election cycle for just four seats in Los Angeles, the campaigns spent about $1.2 million to promote their candidates. But outside groups — largely dueling supporters of the charter school movement and of supporters of unionized teachers who tend to oppose charter schools — spent roughly $16.5 million, nearly 14 times that amount, to bombard the voters with propaganda.     The resulting board in LA now has a narrow advantage for charter proponents. But such a result would be far from guaranteed in Chicago, where the Chicago Teachers Union has in recent years demonstrated that it has considerable muscle to flex.     All that we could be sure of would be periodic epic mud fights between people from all over the country with competing philosophical interests in education policy and hopes of influencing how we run our schools. In the naive hope of giving interested local parents a “seat at the table” we would, like Los Angeles, give special interests from coast to coast a lever to yank on without definitive proof that students are better off when school boards are elected.     If such elections are held in off years, turnout will likely be low — fewer than 9% of eligible voters participated in a 2019 special school board election in Los Angeles. And if they’re held at the same time as other major elections — to counter the low turnout problem, Los Angeles held school board elections to coincide with the presidential election last November — average voters are less likely to have focused enough on the down-ballot school races to cast truly informed votes.     No thanks.     The appeal of direct democracy reaches its limit here for me. I’d rather delegate the responsibility for schools to the mayor — as we do responsibility for law enforcement, fire protection and other vital matters — and vote accordingly every four years.     ericzorn@gmail.com     Twitter @EricZorn     Get the week’s best columns, reports, tips, referrals and tirades from columnist Eric Zorn in the Change of Subject newsletter.

View CommentsMississippi Governor Tate Reeves signs the first state bill in the US this year to ban transgender athletes from competing on female sports teams, as supporting lawmakers gather behind him on Thursday at the Capitol in Jackson, Miss.Rogelio V. SolisJACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Republican Governor Tate Reeves signed a bill Thursday to ban transgender athletes from competing on girls or women’s sports teams.Mississippi is the first state this year to enact such a ban, after a federal court blocked an Idaho law last year. Mississippi’s Senate Bill 2536 is set to become law July 1, although a legal challenge is possible.More than 20 states are proposing restrictions on athletics or gender-confirming health care for transgender minors this year. Conservative lawmakers are responding to an executive order by President Biden that bans discrimination based on gender identity in school sports and elsewhere. Biden signed it Jan. 20, the day he took office.Advertisement“But for the fact that President Biden as one of his first initiatives sat down and signed an executive order — which, in my opinion, encourages transgenderism amongst our young people — but for that fact, we wouldn’t be here today,” Reeves said during a ceremony in the Mississippi Capitol, where he was joined by legislators who supported the bill.Alphonso David, president of the LGBTQ civil rights organization Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement Thursday that the Mississippi law could lead to more bullying of transgender people.“This law is a solution in search of a problem, and legislators in Mississippi have not provided any examples of Mississippi transgender athletes gaming the system for a competitive advantage because none exist,” David said.Reeves has three daughters who play sports and he said March 4 on Twitter that Mississippi’s bill would “protect young girls from being forced to compete with biological males for athletic opportunities.”Chase Strangio, a transgender-rights attorney with the national ACLU, said the Mississippi bill “is very vague and seemingly unenforceable.”“Unfortunately, there is already rampant discrimination against trans youth in Mississippi, which means people are already driven out of sport,” Strangio said.AdvertisementThe Mississippi Senate passed the bill Feb. 11, and the House passed it March 3. The votes were largely along party lines, with most Republicans supporting the bill and most Democrats either opposing it or refraining from voting.Republican legislators who pushed the bill gave no evidence of any transgender athletes competing in Mississippi schools or universities.“The coaches have told me that this is an imminent problem in Mississippi, and that’s basically all the details that they were willing to give me,” Republican Senator Angela Hill of Picayune said in response to questions Thursday. “I can’t tell you that they don’t know any examples. I believe they do know examples. I think that they wanted to leave it in general terms. But they told me that this is an urgent matter.”Supporters of bills such as the one in Mississippi argue that transgender girls, because they were born male, are naturally stronger, faster, and bigger than those born female. Opponents say such proposals violate not only Title IX of federal education law prohibiting sex discrimination, but also rulings by the US Supreme Court and US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.Boston Globe videoFollow Us Share on TwitterShare on Facebook Share on InstagramShare on TwitterShare on Facebook Share on InstagramSubscribe NowDigital AccessHome DeliveryGift SubscriptionsMy AccountLog InManage My AccountCustomer ServiceContactHelp & FAQsGlobe NewsroomAdvertiseMoreNewslettersView the ePaperOrder Back IssuesNews in EducationSearch the ArchivesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of PurchaseWork at Boston Globe Media©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC

With kidney disease a worldwide problem, including 37 million sufferers in the U.S. alone and an increasing issue in Israel, World Kidney Day seeks to highlight the importance of kidney health across the world.
By promoting a global awareness campaign centered on the importance of kidneys and how to keep your kidneys healthy, the special day emphasizes how everyone can live a lifestyle that is best for kidney health, even if living with the impact of kidney disease. The theme for 2021 is "Kidney Health for Everyone Everywhere – Living Well with Kidney Disease."
World Kidney Day "aims to increase education and awareness about effective symptom management and patient empowerment, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the meaningful participation in every-day life of people living with kidney disease" and to empower patients and their family members in their care and in all aspects of the disease.
The International Federation of Kidney Foundations – World Kidney Alliance, which founded the day, stresses that a disease-centric approach is not the best way to help patients dealing with chronic kidney disease to live a full life. Rather, there are strategies and approaches to handle and minimize symptoms and outcomes in order to improve quality of life and increase participation in everyday activities.
“Diet and salt intake, access to health care, and access to exercise make a huge difference in kidney health,” Dr. Anupam Agarwal told University of Alabama News.
Ten percent of the world's population has chronic kidney disease (CKD), and over 2 million people are on dialysis treatment or awaiting a transplant.

Microsoft Begins the Process to Shutdown Window Store for Business and Education


Microsoft 365 

Brad Sams | Mar 11, 2021 



If there is one thing that has not materialized in a way that Microsoft had hoped, it would be app stores. The store on Windows 10, while it is filled with apps, has not lived up to the business objectives that were initially outlined and the same can be said for other stores like business and education.
And now it looks like Microsoft is taking more decisive action, at least for the business and education storefronts. The company has announced, via MC244068, that the company is starting to close down the business and education stores.
Specifically, the company says in the message that all apps that are sold, meaning every app that is not free, will no longer be available for purchase in the business or education stores. Further, anonymous browsing of the stores has been disabled and only those with active Azure AD accounts will be able to view the content.
It’s important to note that Minecraft of Education is not impacted by these changes.
If you have purchased apps from these marketplaces, you will still be able to receive updates and access your applications but you can no longer purchase new apps or licenses going forward. After these changes take place, which will occur on April 14th, you will still be able to assign and re-assign the licenses that you have already purchased.



This is a big change for Microsoft and acknowledgment that its store tactics have not materialized in a way that has provided enough value to keep these tools around. If you are a user of this tool or are selling products via this method, this is going to be a big change to your operation.
While this is not the complete shutdown of these storefronts, this is the first big step to sunsetting the services.

Who Was Marie Curie? Learn More About This Pioneering Nobel Prize Winner



                        
                                                            By Madeleine Muzdakis on March 11, 2021

Polish-born researcher and professor Marie Curie is arguably the most well-known female scientist of all time. With an intellect that would have been exceptional in any age, Curie was also remarkable for her achievements in fields dominated almost exclusively by men during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. A woman participating in physics, chemistry, or academia was by its very occurence a pioneering feat. Thankfully, Curie's accomplishments have largely escaped the frequent pitfall for barrier-breaking women—that they are remembered more for their gender than their contributions to their field.
Curie's name has largely become synonymous with the study of radiation. This research likely contributed to the aplastic anaemia which caused her premature death at age 66. Madame Curie handled radioactive isotopes without modern safety procedures, which themselves grew out of her discoveries. Her work, however, has saved countless lives. Radiation therapy is used today as a treatment for certain cancers; Curie was the first to attempt this medical use based on her study of radioactive isotopes in her lab. As the first woman to win a Nobel Prize—and the only person to ever win two in separate scientific fields—Curie is one of the most decorated and respected scientists of any gender. Read on to learn more about the life of an extraordinary mind.
 

Academic from an Early Age

Curie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland as Maria Salomea Skłodowska. The young woman’s father was a mathematics and physics teacher, while her mother ran a school for girls. Despite being well-placed for an excellent education Curie faced several major obstacles. The first, of course, was her gender. She received a high school education at a girl's gymnasium—women were not allowed to attend the local universities. Her Polish nationality (of which she was always proud) posed another issue. Poland was under the control of Russia, and her family had a history of involvement in the Polish resistance to imperial rule. In pursuit of higher education, Curie attended an underground learning institution known as Uniwersytet Latający, or the Flying University.
The Flying University was affordable but clandestine. Originally designed for women to attend, the classes also served as a way to keep Polish culture and academia alive under Russian rule. Despite the ingenuity of the Flying University's model, Curie and her sister Bronisława both wished to study in Paris. She worked several years as a governor and tutor in Poland to support her sister’s medical training in Paris. After her sister's marriage, Curie continued working, studying, and reading. Her first laboratory work was conducted in her cousin's chemistry lab in Warsaw the year before she left Poland. In 1891, she departed her homeland to join her sister in Paris to take her next step in academia.
 
Paris and Pierre

In Paris, Curie became known as Marie (Maria in French) and enrolled at the University of Paris where she focused on physics, chemistry, and math. By 1894, she had achieved two degrees. She was studying magnetism when she met another scientist named Pierre Curie who taught at The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution. Marie joined Pierre’s lab, and he soon fell head over heels for the brilliant young woman. Far from prioritizing his own career, he offered to return to Poland with her if that was what it took to convince her to marry him. However, Marie's career opportunities were limited in Poland, so the couple remained in France. They wed in 1895.
 
A Woman in a Man's World

Working with her husband, Curie began the work required to obtain her PhD. The French physicist Henri Becquerel had recently discovered puzzling rays emanating from uranium. The German scientist Wilhelm Roentgen had also first documented the existence of x-rays. Both phenomenons would become the central questions of Curie’s studies. However, being a married woman in a man's world was difficult in an age when middle and upper-class mothers typically remained at home. In 1897, Curie gave birth to a daughter, Irène. Despite being a new parent, Curie was actively researching other elements that emitted mysterious rays. Her husband joined her, and together in 1898 they published their discovery of the elements polonium (named for Poland) and radium.
The Curies described the elements' mysterious waves as radioactivity, a new term in science. They began to attempt to isolate the elements from the compounds they had previously studied. This was difficult given radioactive elements decay. In 1903, Curie submitted her doctoral thesis addressing radioactivity, entitled Research on Radioactive Substances. She presented the basis of radioactivity and its connection to the structure of atoms. Despite her expertise in the subject, conferences requested her husband as a speaker while she was not invited to address the almost entirely male audience.
 
International Acclaim

In 1903, the same year Marie defended her thesis, the Curies’ work caught the attention of the Nobel Prize Committee. Together with Becquerel, the three scientists were awarded the Physics prize for “their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel.” Marie almost did not receive the award despite her work being arguably the most critical discoveries. Upon hearing that his wife and research partner was not listed for the award, Pierre complained to the committee. Her inclusion was not only right, but a monumental step for female scientists.
In 1906, after the birth of their second child, Pierre was killed in a freak traffic accident in Paris. The University of Paris offered a teaching post promised him to his widow. Devastated at the end of what (by all accounts) seems to have been a true love match with her intellectual soulmate, Curie nonetheless became the first female professor in the almost-800-year history of the university. She became quite distinguished within a decade, with a lab dedicated to the study of radium as a joint endeavor in 1914 between the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.

In 1911, Curie was awarded her second Nobel Prize—this time solo and in Chemistry. The award cited her isolation of the element radium, which she and Pierre had previously discovered. That same year, she attended the first Solvay Conference. This elite gathering of the best minds in the world included Albert Einstein, Max Planck, and Henri Poincaré. Curie was the only woman in attendance, but the entire theme of the conference built upon her work. The attendees discussed “Radiation and the Quanta” from a physics angle. Despite this recognition, Curie returned to a scandal in France. A short affair with a married, but separated, peer scientist proved the vulnerability of her position as a leading female academic. The press coverage was xenophobic as well as sexist.

At her Radium Institute, Curie had been researching the medical applications of her work. Before even receiving her PhD, Curie and her husband had published the effects of radium on cancer cells. With the commencement of the Great War, Curie poured her prize money into war bonds and developed field radiology equipment. Working with her daughter, she trained and directed Red Cross nurses. Her radiology operations treated (and likely saved) untold numbers of soldiers. Her post-war profile—and prolific uses of radium—even earned her a visit to the White House to meet President Warren G. harding. He presented her with a gram of radium (a large amount) to continue her work.
 
The Curie Legacy

In large part, Curie built her own legacy during her lifetime. The Radium Institute is now the Curie Institute, a leader in oncology research. During her lifetime, a Parisian street was given her husband's name, and a radioactivity unit of measure was named the curie. In 1935, her son-in-law and her daughter Irène received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their continuation of her research. Curie passed away the year before, having taken a huge health toll from years of unwitting exposure to extremely radioactive material.
Since her death, Marie Curie has been the namesake of hospitals, museums, and universities dedicated to continuing her brilliant discoveries. An element on the Periodic Table is known as Curium in her and Pierre's honor. The two Curies are buried in the 18th-century Panthéon in Paris—in lead-lined coffins. Even their papers are housed in lead due to the lingering effects of radiation. Curie dedicated her life to science, and in a relatively short career managed to discover the basis of a cancer treatment that today is still the best medicine available. A source of pride to both Poland and France, Curie laid the foundations for generations of women and young scientists.

SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sports For Learning (SFL), an innovative provider of educational support programs with a curriculum that blends social emotional learning (SEL) and physical activity, is aiding nearly 60 school districts across California in getting children back to school safely. Its blended curriculum is aligned with the five core competencies of CASEL (self-awareness, self-management, responsible decision-making, relationship skills and social awareness) as well as California’s physical education standards. It is currently providing relief staff and SEL support for the return to school as well as synchronous and asynchronous distance learning with programs that use fun, physically active games and sports as a vehicle to engage students in social and emotional learning.



“Getting kids safely back to school has presented a host of challenges. District administrators are struggling with stretched resources, teachers are often working double-shifts with morning and afternoon cohorts to keep class sizes small, and students that have been struggling with depression linked to isolation need social-emotional support as they re-engage in school,” said Chris Murphy co-founder and president at Sports For Learning. “We are glad to be working with schools and superintendents to create customizable solutions to address this immediate demand and are proud to be part of the solution for getting kids back to school safely.”

As a first-of-its-kind program uniquely positioned to help school districts confront the challenges of returning to classrooms in a post-pandemic world, SFL has developed more than 36 games and activities customized to ensure children remain both physically distanced and highly engaged. The curriculum supports overall whole-person wellness – academically, socially, emotionally and physically – for students of all ages through a variety of innovative safe-play activities. SFL’s experienced coaches supervise activities on-campus to provide teachers the time they need to take breaks and engage in professional development time, meaning districts can stretch their existing resources further, while parents and students enjoy the proven benefits of access to enriching SEL curriculum.

“Sports For Learning uses physical activity as a vehicle to increase children’s engagement and development, which boosts pro-social behaviors and mitigates disciplinary issues,” added Nick Telford, Sports f=For Learning’s co-founder and CEO. “Of the school districts we have already worked with, 98 percent of district administrators agree that the program has had a positive impact on students’ social emotional wellness resulting in fewer disciplinary issues, better attendance and higher engagement. These outcomes underscore how truly valuable social-emotional learning is in general, but especially in today’s uncertain climate.”

SFL partners with 30 of the 58 counties in California including schools throughout Orange County, Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and Riverside counties and continues to expand access to its online and in-person programs through rollouts at new schools and within new districts.

Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father – Picture: Netflix
One of the best travel-comedy shows on Netflix, Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father, is set to be coming back for a fifth season later in 2021 according to new report from Comedy.co.uk. 
The report states that Jack Whitehall and his father will be back for their fifth global outing but stresses that it’ll be slightly different to seasons beforehand whereby they’ll be sticking locally likely due to the travel restrictions of the global pandemic.
Scotland, Wales and England will be the focus of this round of travels with the pair visiting picturesque British locations including Devon, London, and the Lake District. Filming is due to begin in April 2021.
For those not familiar with the show, it follows a British comedian and his stuck-in-the-mud father traveling the globe with learning and laughs to be had along the way. The first season debuted in 2017 with new seasons releasing every year since.
So far, the pair have visited South East Asia, Europe, the United States and Australia.
Netflix confirmed the report and stated that season 5 of Jack Whitehall’s Travels with My Father will release on Netflix globally later in 2021.

While you’re waiting you can find plenty more Jack Whitehall on Netflix. His most prolific show Bad Education and its subsequent movie are sadly no longer available on Netflix (departing in December 2020 in the US and May 2020 in the UK) but you can find him in his various stand-ups. That includes the 2017 special Jack Whitehall: At Large, Jack Whitehall: Christmas with My Father from December 2019 and the most recent I’m Only Joking special from July 2020.
Are you looking forward to more Jack Whitehall with his father galavanting around the United Kingdom? Let us know in the comments down below.

Microsoft to block users from getting paid apps from the Microsoft Stores for Business, Education as of April
Is Microsoft finally taking the first official step toward the planned closing of the Microsoft Stores for Business and Education? It looks like it.

                                                    Credit: ZDNet
                                                More than a year after plans for closing the Microsoft Stores for Business and Education were discussed internally, Microsoft is notifying customers of the first steps toward their seeming dismantling.  Microsoft Store for Business customers reported receiving an update today, March 11, telling them that all paid apps will no longer "be available for acquisition" from the Stores for Business and Education as of April 14, 2021. (Thanks @hoyty for the heads up on Twitter.)Users who already have apps they got through these stores will be able to use and receive updates to them, according to Microsoft's note to users. But no new paid apps will be possible through these stores as of that April date. After that date, users who want additional applications or licenses will need to work with app publishers, Microsoft says.  The note to customers also says that access to the Store for Business and Store for Education, going forward, will require users to have an existing Azure Active Directory account. No anonymous browsing of these Stores will be permitted.I asked Microsoft if today's announcement is the first step toward toward the dismantling and closing of the Stores for Business and Education. No word back so far.The Microsoft Store, originally known as the Windows Store, is Microsoft's online app store that is built into Windows 10. In 2015, Microsoft started testing a couple of companion digital stores: The Microsoft Store for Business and the Microsoft Store for Education were designed for admins who wanted to make applications available to their users outside of the normal Windows Store channel in Windows 10. They allow admins to make Store apps available to their users for volume acquisition and distribution, as well as provide a way for custom line-of-business distribution only inside a particular organizationAs Microsoft officials acknowledged for the past couple of years, Microsoft's original plan to try to convince developers to create Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that would be updatable and distributable solely via the Microsoft Store failed to materialize. The need for dedicated app stores on Windows became less pressing as a result. To date, Microsoft hasn't said anything publicly about what's going to happen to any of its digital app stores. But privately, officials across various teams at the company had been trying to come up with a concerted strategy, I've heard. As of a year ago, That strategy did not call for Microsoft to drop the Web version of the Microsoft Store. It does sound as though the team that owns the digital stores decided that the Store for Business and Store for Education definitely would be deprecated. There was talk that June 2020 was the target, but that was pre-pandemic.

Facebook Pulls “Culture Fit” Card on Black Applicant With Ph.D.

Photo: Elise Amendola/APMedia and guests mingle before a tour of Facebook’s new offices in Cambridge, Mass., on Jan. 9, 2019. Photo: Elise Amendola/APA Black woman passed over for a job at Facebook told federal regulators that even though she was exceptionally qualified for the position, she was rushed through interviews with entirely white staffers, told she wouldn’t like the job, and advised that the company wanted a strong “culture fit,” according to a complaint to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission provided to The Intercept.
The woman joins three others who have recently complained to the EEOC about anti-Black racism at Facebook. The agency has begun conducting a “systemic” probe of Facebook, looking into whether the company’s own policies further discrimination, Reuters reported earlier this month.Join Our NewsletterOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.I’m inThe complaint comes as evidence piles up that large Silicon Valley companies are not diversifying their predominately white and Asian work forces quickly enough, particularly within high-paying technical and managerial roles. Facebook’s latest diversity report, from July, stated that only 3.9 percent of its U.S. employees were Black and 6.3 percent Hispanic. Google said that in 2020 its U.S. staff was 5.5 percent Black and 6.6 percent Latinx, and, like Facebook, has faced repeated accusations of racist practices, including, just in the last week, that it de-prioritizes applicants from historically Black colleges and universities and that it pushes people who complain about racism to seek mental health care.
The woman, whose attorneys shared her complaint with The Intercept on the condition that she not be named, alleges she was “subjected to Facebook’s pattern or practice of discrimination against Black applicants” during a series of interviews for a managerial position at the company in 2020. In the complaint, filed in December, the applicant says her prior work experience and directly related doctoral degree made her particularly well-suited for the job: partnerships and program manager at Facebook’s Global Impact Partnerships. She adds that her experience and education were brought up only in an early interview with the position’s hiring manager, who she alleges told her, “You have a big brain, you wouldn’t like this job.”
Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.
In the complaint, the applicant says she made it past the initial screening process and was granted further interviews, culminating in a round of in-person meetings with a group of all-white Facebook employees in San Francisco, during which she “sensed that the interviewers were not prioritizing her interviews because all of the interviews seemed rushed after making her wait for several hours.” The complaint notes that the applicant wasn’t interviewed by a single person of color and that the “only Black Facebook employee [she] encountered during the entire hiring process was a receptionist.”
She further alleges that during one of the in-person interviews in California, she was told, “There’s no doubt you can do the job, but we’re really looking for a culture fit.” The term “culture fit” is common in corporate tech culture, typically defined as the quality of hiring someone you’d want to hang out with socially or grab a beer with, but often criticized as little more than a euphemistic stand-in for racial or gender-based discrimination and a way for companies to deflect accusations of hiring bias. Given the overwhelming racial homogeneity of American tech companies and the pervasive belief that they require some sort of common vision of the future as much as any technical skill, determining what the “culture” in question even is or how one might “fit” into it can be impossible if an applicant doesn’t closely resemble a company’s founders or current staff.
Indeed, the applicant’s complaint states that Facebook’s “general policy of discrimination against Black applicants” is built partly on “Facebook’s strong consideration of ‘culture fit’ in hiring, without providing sufficient objective guidance to managers and other employees on how to determine which applicants and employees will be a good ‘culture fit’ at Facebook.”
The three other recent EEOC complaints about Facebook made similar allegations that Facebook relied on “culture fit” and evaluation by white and Asian employees to determine who made the cut. They were filed by Facebook employee Oscar Veneszee Jr. and by two applicants turned down for jobs. All four individuals are represented by attorneys from Gupta Wessler PLLC, Katz Marshall & Banks, and Mehri & Skalet.Wait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn’t done it?

Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren’t on the beat?

The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don’t have ads, so we depend on our members — 35,000 and counting — to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn’t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month.

WASHINGTON, March 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- On Friday, March 19, the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) celebrates Match Day for the 2021 NRMP Main Residency Match. Medical school students and graduates from the United States and around the world will learn in which U.S. residency program they will train for the next three to seven years. Match Day marks the finale of Match Week (March 15-19) and is a momentous occasion for the next generation of physicians. 
"The NRMP is honored to provide a fair, efficient, and reliable Match for thousands of medical students and graduates as they look forward to entering their specialty training," says NRMP President and CEO Donna L. Lamb, DHSc, MBA, BSN. "COVID-19 presented many challenges to the medical education community including remote learning, disrupted clinical rotations, and virtual interviews and we are in awe of the grit and determination medical students and graduates have shown over this past year. Congratulations to all of this year's Match participants."
Match Week ScheduleMatch Week begins on Monday, March 15, at 11:00 a.m. ET when applicants learn if they have matched to a training program. Monday through Thursday, unmatched applicants participate in the Match Week Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program® (SOAP®) to apply for positions that did not fill when the matching algorithm was processed. On Match Day, Friday, March 19, at 12:00 p.m. ET, NRMP releases the results of the Match, including the Advance Data Tables which include key data about Match results.  Additional data will be published in early May in the 2021 Main Residency Match Results and Data Book.

Follow the Joint Match Week Celebration!The NRMP, American Medical Association (AMA), Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)  American Osteopathic Association (AOA), and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) will join together to celebrate the 2021 Main Residency Match on Twitter, Tagboard, and YouTube, Match participants and the medical education community are encouraged to post pictures, videos, and congratulatory messages commemorating the event, and those interested in the transition from undergraduate to graduate medical education are encouraged to follow #Match2021 on social media. 
The Match ProcessFor applicants, the Main Residency Match process begins in the fall during the final year of medical school, when they apply to the residency programs of their choice. Throughout the fall and early winter, applicants interview with programs. From February to early March, applicants and program directors rank each other in order of preference and submit the preference lists to NRMP, which processes them using a computerized mathematical algorithm to match applicants with programs. Research using the NRMP algorithm was a basis for awarding The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2012.
About NRMPThe National Resident Matching Program® (NRMP®) is a private, non-profit organization established in 1952 at the request of medical students to provide an orderly and fair mechanism for matching the preferences of applicants for U.S. residency positions with the preferences of residency program directors. In addition to the annual Main Residency Match® for more than 48,000 registrants, the NRMP conducts Fellowship Matches for more than 60 subspecialties through its Specialties Matching Service® (SMS®).
To schedule an interview with NRMP President and CEO Donna L. Lamb, DHSc, MBA, BSN contact [email protected]. Reporters should contact local medical schools and hospitals directly for details on their Match Day activities and residency program activities.

NT Electoral Commission audit finds $88,000 discrepancy in CLP financial disclosures - ABC News

The audit, conducted by an accounting firm, found a discrepancy of $88,346 between the CLP's electoral disclosure returns published on the NTEC website and receipts in the party's accounting systems.The review said the CLP's accountant excluded receipts with values under $1,500 dollars, when the law required the total of all receipts to be reported.CLP president Jamie DeBrenni told the ABC the party responded to the NTEC soon after the report's publication on Thursday afternoon, to give it the information it required. "As of this afternoon, the CLP has fulfilled all the requirements asked for by the NTEC to their satisfaction and we thank them for working with the party in a courteous way," he said."These are new processes that everyone is working with and all organisations seem to be doing the best they can to comply."How do political donations work in the NT?The way politicians and parties raise money is undergoing change across Australia, and the ABC has looked into whether the Northern Territory's system is becoming more fair and transparent.Read moreA spokesman for the NTEC said it had received the CLP's revised figures and the website would be updated to reflect this.The changes to the NT's electoral donation and expenditure laws include an expenditure cap of $1 million dollars for political parties with 25 candidates and a $40,000 cap for individual candidates.There is also a requirement to set up and operate a campaign-specific bank account to ensure transparency around donations and expenditure.Overall, the NTEC audit found there had been a "satisfactory" level of compliance from political parties and candidates with the new rules.Third-party spending a threat to transparencyBut the auditors recommended the NTEC push the NT Government for a third-party campaigner spending cap to ensure transparency. The NTEC's auditors have urged it to push for a cap on third-party campaigner spending at elections.(Thinkstock: iStockphoto)Third-party campaigners in the NT have included organisations like unions, environmental groups, GetUp and the Friends of Fannie Bay group. "There is no limit on what the third-party campaigners can spend in respect of electoral activities during the election period while there is a spending cap of $40,000 on candidates," the audit report said."This situation may end up undermining the relevance of the spending cap imposed on candidates as electoral activity spending may be redirected through the third-party campaigners."There is currently no requirement for third-party campaigners to keep separate bank accounts so the NTEC's auditors had trouble identifying their expenses.The auditors noted that despite requests they could not get any information from the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union for the purposes of the review."As a result, we are unable to determine the accuracy and completeness of the figures disclosed in the disclosure return lodged with the NTEC and whether the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union has complied with all its obligations under the Electoral Act," the report states.Confusion about electorate office resourcesThe review also found confusion among different party candidates about rules that prohibit the use of electorate office resources during an election campaign period."An instance was encountered in which the sitting member mentioned that there were insufficient guidelines to follow in relation to the utilisation of electorate office resources during the deemed election period," the report said.More education for sitting members about these rules was needed, the auditors said.Labor needed a better process for refunding self-funded candidates promptly, according to the review, but was the only party that kept track of volunteer activity with a register."The register is essential where consideration has to be made if the volunteer activity is considered as deemed donations to the party and would require reporting," the report said.The review noted the NT Greens set up a campaign bank account only in July 2020, about a month before the election, and that the account had also been used for non-election transactions.Posted  35mminutes agoThuThursday 11 MarMarch 2021 at 9:29pmShareCopy linkTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppRelated StoriesHow do political donations work in the Northern Territory?More on:NTDarwinAlice SpringsGovernment and PoliticsPolitical PartiesElectoral SystemNews in LanguageListen to the news in Warlpiri, Yolngu Matha and KriolTop Stories'Not a racist family': Prince William speaks after brother's comments in Oprah interviewAll Diana wanted was for her sons to be close.

Story Of America’s First Woman In Space Told In New Young Adult Book


      Thursday, March 11, 2021
      
    
By Brooke Ruth, Maureen Cavanaugh

The cover of "She Persisted: Sally Ride" is pictured.


Sally Ride, America’s first woman in space, left a legacy for young girls here in San Diego and around the world. 
Her history-making trips aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger and her work as a physicist at UC San Diego serve as an inspiration to women and girls interested in all-things science. 
Ride helped launch Sally Ride Science, which is now a nonprofit dedicated to inspiring kids, especially girls, to pursue studies and careers in science, technology, engineering, and math.
Now Ride’s story is being told along with 12 other inspiring women profiled in the "She Persisted" young adult book series. And Ride’s book is lucky enough to come out this month — Women's History Month.
The young adult series was inspired by Chelsea Clinton's picture book series that started off with, "She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World."
The author of "She Persisted: Sally Ride," Atia Abawi, joined Midday Edition to discuss Ride's life and legacy.

Second Democrat announces challenge against Cawthorn 


    By Sarah Polus - 03/11/21 04:27 PM EST

Josh Remillard, an Iraq war veteran, has become the second Democrat to announce a challenge to Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) in the next congressional election, according to the Citizen Times.The 38-year-old announced his candidacy for North Carolina's 11th District House seat on Wednesday in a statement obtained by the Citizen Times."I served in the Army for eight years, including two combat tours; I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and do the hard work of strengthening our economy, fixing a broken health-care system, and improving our kids’ education," Remillard wrote.ADVERTISEMENTRemillard is the second challenger to Cawthorn's seat. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, a local county commissioner, announced her plans to run against the first-term lawmaker last week.According to his website, Remillard plans to work to expand Medicaid, raise teacher pay and reduce the state's reliance on fossil fuels.Remillard also took aim at Cawthorn, 25, writing that "Western North Carolina deserves better."He added, "We deserve leaders that will uphold the Constitution and make our lives better, not someone who would incite insurrection and prey on women."Remillard's comment follows allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Cawthorn while he was attending college. The young congressman has also faced scrutiny over his role in inciting the Jan. 6 riot, after he spoke at a Trump rally in the nation's capital earlier that day.

‘Everybody Shouldn’t Be Voting,’ Republican Blurts Out


By Jonathan Chait









       


Photo: Ross D Franklin/AP/Shutterstock



Representative John Kavanagh, a Republican legislator who chairs Arizona’s Government and Elections Committee and is shepherding through a bill to make voting more cumbersome and therefore rare, described his party’s motives with blundering candor.
“There’s a fundamental difference between Democrats and Republicans,” he told CNN. “Democrats value as many people as possible voting, and they’re willing to risk fraud. Republicans are more concerned about fraud, so we don’t mind putting security measures in that won’t let everybody vote — but everybody shouldn’t be voting … Not everybody wants to vote, and if somebody is uninterested in voting, that probably means that they’re totally uninformed on the issues. Quantity is important, but we have to look at the quality of votes, as well.”
Kavanagh’s error was to articulate in public beliefs that conservatives prefer to leave to members of their movement who aren’t accountable to the electorate. If I had to guess, his argument is something he’s picked up from reading conservative media, and he never realized his role as elected official makes it unwise to repeat — especially on-camera.
Donald Trump’s presidency, with its continuous demands to silence his opposition and efforts to undermine the election, highlighted his party’s anti-democratic character. But hostility to democracy is a long tradition on the right, including (perhaps especially) in its loftiest highbrow quarters.
Respectable conservative organs like National Review not only supported segregation and opposed civil rights, but also opposed laws to safeguard voting rights. The NR formula on voting rights has always combined several classic elements. First, there are usually some arch, snobbish gibes at right-wing populist demagogues, who are crass and beneath the dignity of the deserving elites at National Review. Second, the dismissal of rank bigotry is set against a “frank” concession that most Black people do not actually deserve the franchise because they are, like the poor whites who support the demagogues, too ignorant to exercise their vote wisely. And third, it declares states’ rights to be the paramount consideration, so that ultimately no federal solution can be imposed, however troubling the abuses of the state-level authorities.
In 1965, James J. Kilpatrick’s National Review cover story dismissed the need for a Voting Rights Act. Yes, Kilpatrick conceded, white Southerns had mistreated Black people. (“No reasonable man would deny that in times past, the South has sinned against the Negro; here and there, in times present, the abuse continues.”) However, the fact remained, “Over most of this century, the great bulk of Southern Negroes have been genuinely unqualified for the franchise. They emerged illiterate from slavery; they remained for generations, metaphorically, under the age of twenty-one.” And the principle of federalism meant Congress could not dictate voting procedures to the states, so, sadly, the Voting Rights Act “undertakes to remedy a perversion of the Constitution by perverting the Constitution.”
A 1966 column by Buckley began with some mockery of Alabama governor George Wallace. But Buckley proceeded to his main point. “For some reason it has been hailed as a triumph of democratic justice that so many Negroes succeeding in voting last week,” he sneered, mocking the absurdity of illiterate Black Alabamans being permitted to vote. Weighing the competing absurdities of the two “evils” — Wallace’s buffoonery, or Black people voting despite having been denied an education by their state — he concluded “the latter” was worse. (The text of these columns are not online. Joshua Tait, a University of North Carolina historian specializing in conservative thought, shared the quotes with me.)
After the 1960s, most mainstream conservatives abandoned their defense of de jure segregation in the South, and two decades later had to abandon their defense of the same system in South Africa. But the idea that voting rights ought to be restricted remains a staple of conservative thought to this day. The chilly reception National Review and other right-wing elites afforded Trump was in keeping with their traditional contempt for demagoguery. But the danger they identified in him was not that he threatened democracy, but seemed in their mind to embody it. “We must weed out ignorant Americans from the electorate,” insisted David Harsanyi in 2016. National Review’s Kevin Williamson, in a column last year headlined “On the Dangers of Democracy,” warned, “The rising authoritarianism of our time is not an aberration but the ordinary natural fulfillment of mass democracy when it has overflowed its constitutional restraints.”
Conservatives are hysterical in opposition to proposals in Congress to guarantee voting access and limit gerrymandering. National Review calls H.R. 1, the main House bill to promote election reform, “a partisan assault on American democracy.” But NR should be more honest in its criticism: Democracy is not what it wants at all, and never has been.

Amazon doesn’t let public libraries purchase copies of the e-books and audiobooks it publishes
[Amazon] won’t sell downloadable versions of its more than 10,000 e-books or tens of thousands of audiobooks to libraries. That’s right, for a decade, the company that killed bookstores has been starving the reading institution that cares for kids, the needy and the curious. And that’s turned into a mission-critical problem during a pandemic that cut off physical access to libraries and left a lot of people unable to afford books on their own.… since 2009, Amazon has published books and audiobooks under its own brands including Lake Union, Thomas & Mercer and Audible. Amazon is a beast with many tentacles: It’s got the store, the reading devices and, increasingly, the words that go on them.Librarians have been no match for the beast. When authors sign up with a publisher, it decides how to distribute their work. With other big publishers, selling e-books and audiobooks to libraries is part of the mix — that’s why you’re able to digitally check out bestsellers like Barack Obama’s “A Promised Land.” Amazon is the only big publisher that flat-out blocks library digital collections. Search your local library’s website, and you won’t find recent e-books by Amazon authors Kaling, Dean Koontz or Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Nor will you find downloadable audiobooks for Trevor Noah’s “Born a Crime,” Andy Weir’s “The Martian” and Michael Pollan’s “Caffeine.”



Want to borrow that e-book from the library? Sorry, Amazon won’t let you.

Cincinnati State joining Miami, Xavier and UC in returning to campus in fall 2021Madeline Mitchell
 
| Cincinnati Enquirer
Cincinnati State Technical and Community College plans to return to fully in-person learning in fall 2021, officials announced Thursday afternoon.Cincinnati State is an open access college with locations in Clifton, Harrison, Evendale and Middletown. Miami University, University of Cincinnati and Xavier University made similar announcements regarding fall 2021 plans in March. Those universities and Cincinnati State cited the COVID-19 vaccine rollout as a source of optimism for reopening.Robbin Hoopes, provost of Cincinnati State, said the college's faculty, staff and students have done a "magnificent job" of dealing with the pandemic in a Thursday news release."As the risk from COVID comes down to an acceptable level, we need to be fully back on campus as part of our commitment to quality," Hoopes said. "Many of our degrees prepare students for careers in advanced technical, health care, culinary and other fields. In-person instruction is how we ensure students have the high level of training and hands-on skills they need to be successful in the workforce."There will still be some online classes available for students, just as there were prior to the pandemic, officials said. There will also be a "live web" platform available for many general education courses, where students can participate remotely with a live classroom on a regular schedule. Those general education courses are transferable to four-year universities throughout the state and nationwide.Cincinnati State will offer remote and on-campus student support services in the fall in the forms of tutoring, writing center support and academic advising."While this past year has been challenging for everyone, we learned a lot about how to better serve our busy students through a creative mix of in-person and remote education and services," Cincinnati State president Monica Posey said. "But we are very excited about being fully back on campus this fall, and continuing our mission of preparing students for advanced technical and health careers, and ongoing higher education."Cincinnati State students can register online beginning March 29, officials said. Fall semester course offerings will be posted March 22 on the university's website.
