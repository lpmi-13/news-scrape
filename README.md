# grabbing some data from newsapi.org

This is a simple and inefficient python method to grab some text from the newsapi.org API.

You'll need to sign up for an API key, and then load that into your environment before running the script like so:

```
export API_KEY=THIS_IS_THE_API_KEY_VALUE
```

and be sure to install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then just run the script

```
python test.py
```

## the data

Will be output to `content.txt`...take a look at the file in this repo to see what it looks like.
